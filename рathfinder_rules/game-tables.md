| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -15 | **Helpful**:  (Intimate; someone with whom you have an implicit trust; a lover or spouse)                                                                                           | **Fantastic**: (The reward for accepting the deal is very worthwhile; the risk is either acceptable or extremely unlikely. The best-case scenario is a virtual guarantee. Example: An offer to pay a lot of gold for information that isn't important to the character.)                                               |
| -10 | **Friendly**:  (someone with whom you have a regularly positive personal relationship; a long-time buddy or sibling)                                                                | **Good**: (The reward is good and the risk is minimal. The subject is very likely to proift from the deal. Example: An offer to pay someone twice their normal daily wage to spend their evening in a seedy tavern with a reputation for vicious brawls and later report on everyone they saw there.)                  |
| -5  | **Ally**: (someone on the same team, but with whom you have no personal relationship; a cleric of the same religion or a knight serving the same king)                              | **Favorable**: (The reward is appealing, but there's risk involved. If all goes according to plan, though, the deal will end up benefiting the subject. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against a weak goblin tribe in return for a cut of the money and first pick of the magic items.) |
| -2  | **Acquaintance** — Positive: (someone you've met several times with no particularly negative experiences; the blacksmith that buys your looted equipment regularly)                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 0   | **Indifferent**: (Doesn't care about you either way. Most NPCs start out indifferent.)                                                                                              | **Even**: (The reward and risk more of less even out; or the deal involves neither reward nor risk. Example: A request for directions to a place that isn't a secret.)                                                                                                                                                 |
| +2  | **Unfriendly**:  (someone you've met several times with no particularly positive experience; the town guard that has arrested you for drunkenness once or twice)                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| +5  | **Hostile**: (someone on an opposed team with whom you have no personal relationship; a cleric of an opposed religion or the orc bandit robbing you)                                | **Unfavorable**: (The reward is not enough compared to the risk involved. Even if all goes according to plan, chances are it will end badly for the subject. Example: A request to free a prisoner the target is guarding for a small amount of money.)                                                                |
| +10 | **Personal Foe**:  (someone with whom you have a regularly antagonistic personal relationship; an evil overlord you're trying to thwart or a bounty hunter sworn to track you down) | **Bad**: (The reward is poor and the risk is high. The subject is very likely to get the raw end of the deal. Example: A request for a mercenary to aid the party in battle against an ancient red dragon for a small cut of any non-magical treasure.)                                                                |
| +15 | **Nemesis**: (someone who has sworn to do you, personally, harm; the brother of a man you murdered in cold blood)                                                                   | **Horrible**: (There is no conceivable way that the proposed plan could end up with the subject ahead or the worst-case scenario is guaranteed to occur. Example: An offer to trade a rusty kitchen knife for a shiny new longsword.)                                                                                  |
