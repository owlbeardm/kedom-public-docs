# Creating character

## About pathfinder

[Quick summary](https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx) of rules from Archives of Nethys.

Almost all decribed options can be found in [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/). If something is differ from original rules and setting I would specify it here.

Players can select any valid **Common** option. **Uncommon**, **Rare** and **Unique** options can be selected after consulting with GM.

## Character Creation

### Step 1. Create a Concept

This includes such options as [Ancestry](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx), [Background](https://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx), [Class](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx). It doesn't have to be exact mechanical options. Just vague copcept of what you hero will be.  
Create a name for you character (Please use [guidlines](/world/names/) and consult with GM).

In this setting rarity of Classes and Ancestries are differs from original rules:

    ##### Rare and unique Ancestries
    - The rest

### Step 2. Ancestry

- Pick the ancestry itself: [Ancestries](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx).
- Select a **heritage** from those available within that ancestry. (Can be found in Heritages submenu on selected Ancestry page)
- Choose an **ancestry feat**, representing an ability your hero learned at an early age. (Can be found in Feats submenu on selected Ancestry page)


### Step 3. Class

- Pick a class: [Classes](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx)
- Note a **Key Ability** of this class. 
- Class almost always have suboption (like Research Fields for Alchemist or Arcane Schools and Arcane Thesis for wizard). Consider what would you like for your hero. (This options can be found in submenu on selected Class page).


### Step 4. Background

- Pick a Background: [Backgrounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx)
- Note ability boosts it provides.
- Mark Skill and Skill Feat it provides.

All **General Backgrounds** are common. **Legacy** and **Regional** backgrounds should be discussed with GM.

### Step 5. Abilities

You class page has **Class Features** table. Read features for first level and select required options if it has variants.

If options are match you can select any other variant. For example your class and you background provides trained proficiency in same skill that means you gain trained in that skill and any other skill you choose.

### Step 5. Equipment

New Hero starts with 15 gp. You can save time by buying kit for you class: [Class Kits](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=240). Or you can buy all equipment yourself: [Equipment](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx)

??? info "Equipment info"
    - Armor, shields, and weapons have all of the mundane armaments needed for combat, as well as ones made of precious materials or that possess special magical abilities.
    - Other nonmagical gear can be found under the adventuring gear category.
    - Alchemical items are powered by the reactions of alchemical reagents. Almost all alchemical items are consumable items that are used up when you activate them and this category includes bombs, elixirs, poisons, and other alchemical tools.
    - Consumables are used up when you activate them, and include ammunition, oils, potions, scrolls, and talismans, among others. Categories of items that are consumables but have specific rules, such as alchemical items, are presented separately.
    - Held Items include a wide variety of items you use with your hands but doesn't include more narrow categories of held items, such as weapons.
    - Materials can be used to make items with unique properties and other advantages.
    - Runes modify armor and weapons when etched onto them. This section includes fundamental runes for weapons (weapon potency and striking) and armor (armor potency and resilient).
    - Snares are single-use traps typically made by rangers.
    - Staves provide flexible spellcasting options.
    - Structures include buildings, tents, and other larger items.
    - Wands hold a spell of the crafter's choice, and can be used to repeatedly cast that spell.
    - Worn Items consist of a vast collection of clothing and other items you wear on your body.


### Step 6. The rest

Calculations of modifies and stats from all options selected. If you use [character.pf2.tools](https://character.pf2.tools/) it is done automatically.

#### Creating caracter using **character.pf2.tools**

##### Step 0. Character setup

I'm using [Expanded Rules](/Ñ€athfinder_rules/variant-rules/) in this setting. So some options should be enabled in character.pf2.tools when character created:

- **Proficiency without Level**: 
- **Automatic Bonus Progression**: create `ADJUSTMENT` \ `AUTOMATIC BONUS PROGRESSION` and paste there 
        ``` 
            ATTACK +0 ITEM
            SKILLNAME +0 ITEM
            DAMAGEDICE +0 ITEM
            AC +0 ITEM
            PERCEPTION +0 ITEM
            SAVES +0 ITEM
        ```
