# Creating character

## About pathfinder

If you don't know whats "Pathfinder 2E" is or if you didn't play tabletop role-playing game before check out [quick summary](https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx) of rules from Archives of Nethys. Especially **Getting Started** in **How to Play** section.

Almost all decribed options can be found in [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/). If something is differ from original rules and setting I would specify it here.

Players can select any valid **Common** option. **Uncommon**, **Rare** and **Unique** options can be selected after consulting with GM.

This includes such options as [Ancestry](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx), [Background](https://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx), [Class](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx). It doesn't have to be exact mechanical options. Just vague copcept of what you hero will be.  
Create a name for you character (Please use [guidlines](/world/names/) and consult with GM).

In this setting rarity of Classes and Ancestries are differs from original rules:

### Step 2. Ancestry

- Select a **heritage** from those available within that ancestry. (Can be found in Heritages submenu on selected Ancestry page)

- Note ability boosts it provides.
- Mark Skill and Skill Feat it provides.

All **General Backgrounds** are common. **Legacy** and **Regional** backgrounds should be discussed with GM.

At first level every hero recieves 4 free ability boosts in addition to ancestry, class and background boosts.

You class page has **Class Features** table. Read features for first level and select required options if it has variants.

If options are match you can select any other variant. For example your class and you background provides trained proficiency in same skill that means you gain trained in that skill and any other skill you choose.

### Step 6. Equipment

### Step 7. The rest

Calculations of modifies and stats from all options selected. If you use [character.pf2.tools](https://character.pf2.tools/) it is done automatically.

#### Creating caracter using **character.pf2.tools**

##### Step 1. Concept

Lets's create Merlin character. That makes him *human* *wizard* with already established name. 

!![](screen/step-0-name.gif)

Merlin's traditional biography casts him as a cambion, a being born of a mortal woman, sired by an incubus. That makes him *tiefling*. Merlin matures to an ascendant sagehood and engineers the birth of Arthur through magic and intrigue. Some king of *scholar* character.

##### Step 2. Ancestry

Merlin is [Human](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=6). Which gives him **8 hp**, **medium size**, **25 feet land speed**, **2 free ability boosts**, **Common + 1 + your Intelligence modifier additional languages**.

!![](screen/step-1-a.gif)

His Human Heritage will be [Tiefling](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=26) Versatile Heritage. Which gives him **low-light vision**. And ability to choose tiefling ancestry feats.

!![](screen/step-1-h.gif)

For his ancestry feat we'll choose **Devil's Advocate**.

!![](screen/step-1-f.gif)

##### Step 3. Class

We established that Merlin is [Wizard](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=12). Often called enchanter.

Wizard's Key Ability: **INTELLIGENCE**. And wizard gets **6 plus your Constitution modifier** hit points per level. 

!![](screen/step-2-c.gif)

Wizard gets two subclass options. [Arcane School](https://2e.aonprd.com/ArcaneSchools.aspx) would be **Enchantment** (since he's called enchanter). His [Arcane Thesis](https://2e.aonprd.com/ArcaneThesis.aspx) would be **Metamagical Experimentation**.

!![](screen/step-2-o.gif)

##### Step 4. Background

Merlin's background would be [Scholar](https://2e.aonprd.com/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=36). Which gives **Int** or **Wis** and free ability boost. Trained proficiency in **Arcana**, **Nature**, **Occultism**, or **Religion** skill, and the **Academia Lore** skill. And **Assurance** skill feat.

!![](screen/step-3.gif)

##### Step 5. Abilities

4 free abilities:

!![](screen/step-4-a.gif)

Wizard's class features are:

- **ancestry and background**: already done
- **initial proficiencies**: trained in
    - Perception
    - Fortitude
    - Reflex
    - **Expert** in Will
    - Arcana (already trained from background, so changed to Occultism)
    - number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier (which is 2+4)
    - club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, and staff
    - unarmed attacks
    - unarmored defense
    - arcane spell attacks and arcane spell DCs
    !![](screen/step-5-p.gif)
- **arcane spellcasting**: giving 5 cantrips slots and 2 1st level spells per day. And spellbook with 10 cantrips and 5 1st-level spells. We will use *Sample Spellbook*.
    !![](screen/step-5-s.gif)
- **arcane school** gives us +1 enchantment spell (charm) to the book and *charming words* focus spell.
    !![](screen/step-5-sch.gif)
- **arcane bond** class feature
    !![](screen/step-5-ab.gif)
- **arcane thesis**: METAMAGICAL EXPERIMENTATION gives us metamagic feat. We'll choose *Reach Spell*.
    !![](screen/step-5-at.gif)


##### Step 6. Equipment

[Wizard Kit](https://2e.aonprd.com/ClassKits.aspx?Class=12) comes with **staff**,  **adventurer's pack**, **material component pouch**, **writing set** and optional **crossbow** with **20 bolts**. We'll take all of it which lefts us with 8 gp 8 sp.

!![](screen/step-6.gif)

##### Step 7. The rest

All bonuses are automatically calculated. But Merlin doesn't have any attacks displayed. We'll add staff and crossbow that are already bought: 

!![](screen/step-7-a.gif)

##### Extra Step. Character setup

I'm using [Expanded Rules](/Ñ€athfinder_rules/variant-rules/) in this setting. So some options should be enabled in character.pf2.tools when character created:

- **Proficiency without Level**: use no level in bonuses.
    !![](screen/step-e-lvl.gif)
- **Automatic Bonus Progression**: create `ADJUSTMENT` \ `AUTOMATIC BONUS PROGRESSION` and paste there 
        ``` 
            ATTACK +0 ITEM
            SKILLNAME +0 ITEM
            DAMAGEDICE +0 ITEM
            AC +0 ITEM
            PERCEPTION +0 ITEM
            SAVES +0 ITEM
        ```
    !![](screen/step-e-aba.gif) 
- **Public access**: send link to your GM. [Merlin's sheet](https://character.pf2.tools/?zL7coqH6)
    !![](screen/step-e-pub.gif) 


#### Finished character

Finised [Merlin's sheet](https://character.pf2.tools/?zL7coqH6).
